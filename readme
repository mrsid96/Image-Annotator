This is an image annotation script. 
Basically it highlights section of the images for which would be annotated.

Arguments expected from the class:
1. annotatorMap (required)
2. imageId (required)
3. canvasId (optional)
4. tableId (optional)
5. annotateColor (optional)
6. annotateOpacity (optional)

"imageId", "canvasId", and "tableId" are basically the "id" of the HTML elements.
"annotateColor" - it expects a hex color code, passed as string
"annotateOpacity" - it expects a floating point number, 1.0 being solid, and 0.0 being complete transparent.

"annotatorMap" is basically a JSON Array which expects objects in the below format

{
    rawText: "Job Purpose",
    coordinates: [
        { x: 10, y: 10 }, { x: 80, y: 10 },
        { x: 10, y: 40 }, { x: 80, y: 40 }
    ]
}

Here, rawText is the display text for the annotation, which when hovered should highlight on image
and coordinates are [point1, point2, point3, point4].
